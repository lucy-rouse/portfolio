            <p>
                Hi! I'm Lucy Rouse, a first-time web designer from Albany, Oregon. 
                Computer Science 110 is my first ever Computer Science related class,
                but I've enjoyed it so much that I signed up for Computer Science 111 for spring term.
                <br>
                I'm a first-year undergraduate student at the University of Oregon,
                and I'm majoring in Business Administration. I enjoy crafting a lot, which is what 
                inspired me to make this website about one of my favorite hobbies, junk journaling.
                <br>
                If you're interested in learning more about me, the image above is a link to my resume!
